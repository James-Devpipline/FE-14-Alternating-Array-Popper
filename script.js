/* 
Alternating Array Popper
  Using OOP, build a program that will take an array, and alternate between removing from the front and back every time your method is run.
EX:
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arrayPopper() => 1
arrayPopper() => 5
arrayPopper() => 2
arrayPopper() => 4
arrayPopper() => 3
arrayPopper() => undefined
*/

function arrayPopper(arrayInput) {
  count = 0;
  // have count be 0 (falsey) to signify that it needs to take from the front, then have it be 1 (truthy) to signify it needs to take from the back
}
